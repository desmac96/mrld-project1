    </ul>
    <h2 id="design">Design</h2>
    <h3>Colour Scheme</h3>
    <p>The two main colours used are black and white. They work well with the colours in the hero image. Grey is used in the services section to create distinct sections that stand out against the black background. Green is also used for the sign-up form button to match the green in the hero image.</p>
    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <p>The two fonts used on this website are Montserrat and Kanit. They were imported through Google Fonts. They are quite similar and work well together. Their style suits the kind of website MRLD needed. Sans Serif is the fallback font in case the custom fonts are not imported correctly. I got inspiration to use the Montserrat font from the PIV Records website.</p>
    <h3>Imagery</h3>
    <p>Imagery is very important when building a website. The large background hero image is designed to catch the user's eye and also familiarize the user with the MRLD logo.</p>
